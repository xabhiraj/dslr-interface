# dslr_interface

Current version supports viewing the summary of a connected DSLR, and viewing and changing camera parameters (ISO, white balance, aperture, and shutter speed). 

Next steps: Pipe output of capture-movie as a proxy for live view. Switch to Python interface instead of subprocess to CLI.
